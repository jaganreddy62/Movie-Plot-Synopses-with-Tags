# Movie-Plot-Synopses-with-Tags
Analysis tags based on movie plots
Abstract Social tagging of movies reveals a wide range of heterogeneous information about movies, like the genre, plot structure,
soundtracks, metadata, visual and emotional experiences. Such information can be valuable in building automatic systems to create
tags for movies. Automatic tagging systems can help recommendation engines to improve the retrieval of similar movies as well as
help viewers to know what to expect from a movie in advance
